    <p>Hello, welcome to my portfolio webpage. My name is Eddie Borja. I've recently enrolled with 
        UCI Coding Bootcamp and so far its been exciting. Two weeks ago I didnt feel very comfortable 
        with HTML and CSS but its getting easier. My teachers are always great at explaining things and 
        make it fun to learn.
    </p>
        
    <p>There are two big reason why i joined this bootcamp. Firstly, I have alot of
        personal ideas for websites. I spend alot of time on the internet and always find my 
        self asking "why hasn't anyone created a website for that already". Secondly, working to 
        create amazing websites with a team that is likeminded excites me. Working as a team really helps 
        me learn new things.  
    </p>
